# Welcome to My Portfolio Website Code Repository!

Welcome! You've reached the repository for the code of my portfolio website, a project I'm continuously developing. I won't delve into installation details or running instructions here, since the website is live and accessible at [https://gavrilchik.net](https://gavrilchik.net). Instead, let me share what I find particularly cool in this project:


## Responsive navbar made  without a single line of javascript

Check out the responsive navbar [here](app/views/layouts/_navbar.haml) and [here](app/assets/stylesheets/navbar.tailwind.css). It's entirely crafted without JavaScript. It's not that I have anything against JavaScriptâ€”in fact, it's one of my favorite languages. However, I know that web apps often accumulate scripts unnecessarily, much like barnacles on a pirate ship. One less thing to attract them. And I really like how I made the mobile view.


## TypeScript + React in a Rails Frontend

See the integration of TypeScript and React into the Rails frontend [here](config/initializers/sprockets_rails.rb), [here](app/javascript/react/loader.tsx) and [here](app/javascript/react/urls/URLShortener.tsx). I've also written an article about this approach [here](https://dev.to/gavrilarails/ruby-on-rails-with-react-on-typescript-using-importmaps-5082). This method is is a very promising way to have reactive components and classic server side rendered pages in the same app (Yes, Rails has SSR since 2004!)

## SQL Triggers in Rails

Discover the integration of SQL triggers in Rails [here](db/triggers/add_unique_short_to_urls_on_insert.sql). The concept of the trigger is relatively simple, but in my experience, it's often overlooked in large projects. People tend to forget that databases can has triggers. I believe I've positioned it in a place that every developer visits time to time.
